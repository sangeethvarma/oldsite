   The current pandemic of COVID-19, that is Corona Virus Disease 2019, is caused by a virus. It might be more appropriate to call it a family of viruses, since there are many varieties of the same basic virus. What is similar between the virus varieties (or variants) is the most basic chemical structure, which is called the RNA, and some of the chemicals (proteins) that make up it's body (cell). In particular, the virus' body is covered in spikes, as seen in all the images, which are made of a particular kind of protein. The different types of vaccines use the knowledge of this common chemical structure to help our body recognise and fight the virus if it gets in our body. The differences in the different types of vaccines is primarily in what way it makes the body prepare to recognise the virus.

<br />
   The "mRNA vaccines" or "adenovirus vaccines"  make either our own bodies' cells or a safe virus-like cells respectively produce proteins similar to the COVID-19 virus' body and make our bodies' immunity or defense system able to recognise and prepared to attack if they see that kind of protein again. Some other vaccines use deactivated (i.e. killed, unable to reproduce or give disease) COVID-19 virus itself. Some others will use just the protein from the spikes. So, once our body's mechanism to detect possibly dangerous things from outside (which are some of the white blood cells) see these, they will start producing things (other kinds of white blood cells) to fight them. This response is like a training for the real virus, since the things produced or delivered by the vaccine is not dangerous. The response also creates similar effects as if it were actually fighting a virus, but milder - which is why we may have fevers or body aches or fatigue or so on, depending on our bodies fighting strategy and strength.

   If a virus gets into your body, it tries to take over some systems in the body to start reproducing very fast. When there is more virus, various systems in our body start to get effected or damaged because they can't work properly. So, if you are vaccinated - or if you have survived getting the virus before - your body recognises the virus as soon as its defence mechanism encounters it and attacks it before it can reproduce a lot. This might be enough to completely get rid of it, or at least gives our body a better chance to fight it and thus reduces the effect of the disease. In the second case, the virus does not get a chance to freely infect the body and gives the immune system more time to fight it.

<br />
   Since having a high number of the virus in your body also makes it more likely that you can spread the disease, if you are vaccinated, you might have be less likely to do so. However, if your body is fighting the virus but you are not symptomatic - say because you are young and healthy - you might still spread it. So, care is still needed.

<br />
   The different variants of the virus become dangerous if the chemicals in them are so different from the ones the scientists used to make the vaccines that you took, they might not be as easily recognised. In this case, booster shots that make your body more prepared might be necessary.
