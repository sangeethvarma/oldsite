<p>Hello!
<p>I'm Sangeeth.
<p>I am interested in questions about information, knowledge, common sense, policy and progress.
<p>Currently engaging with topics of public understanding and perceptions of science(s) and the philosophy of science, and their relation to crises. Especially how complexity and crises are reflected in our understanding of the world, in order to find our ways through.
