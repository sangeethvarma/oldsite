<p>Hello!
<p>I'm Sangeeth.
<p>I am interested in questions about information, knowledge, common sense, policy and progress.
<p>Currently engaging with topics of public understandings of science(s) and philosophy of science, in relation to crises. Particularly interested in how complexity and crises are reflected in our understanding of the world, in order to find ways through them.
